# brainf
A brainfuck interpreter in C. Made by me!  
Though, literally everyone has done this.
114 semicolons have been used so far.
## What is brainfuck?
It's a... uh... I-   
Just read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
## How to run this?
```
make
./brainfuck -f <file>
```
...or if you feel like using REPL (though not yet fully functional):
```
./brainfuck
```
## Why did you make this?
I saw a video on brainfuck by fireship and my brain decided to make something. I really don't know why my brain acts like that, but it was nice making what I made.
## TODO
- Better memory management.
- Better error handling (specially for REPL).
- Fix potential undefined behaviour and bugs.
## Updates from last version:
I'm dumb.
## Anything else?
I dislike swearing when it comes to code somehow.
